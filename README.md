# Introduction: 
Day planner is a productivity tool that helps organize and prioritize the events through out a calendar day.
This day planner helps in ensuring that the essential tasks are completed first in an average 9am to 5pm work day.

# Technologies used:

- HTML => for Base skeleton 
- CSS => formatting the design
- Bootstrap => for preset HTML designs
- Javascript and JQuery => for logic and 
- Moment.js => for times and date formatting

# Lessons Learned:

1. Bootstrap is a phenomenal tool that saves time on designs.
2. While the Moment.js developers are not actively supporting Moment.js , it is still a functional date/time library that can handle basic time/date formatting features. The developers were kind to refer to other supported date/time platforms for bigger projects.
3. Commenting on the codes helps keep the workflow organized and easier to refer to for clarifications/corrections.
